            This is a stock photo of an elderly lady with a handgun. For the sake of this 
            page, we're going to call her my Grandma and I'm going to tell you all about 
            why she's such an amazing person!

        <p>My grandma is badass, she can fire a handgun like this and not hurt herself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My grandma is also amazing because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>She's 80 years old and acts like she's still in her 20s</li>
            <li>She gives zero f*cks what anyone thinks of her</li>
            <li>She owns and manages her own italian restaurant/mafia</li>
        </ul>

            This is a footer, I guess you'd find a 'contact us' button and something about 
            getting a job at my company. We're too prestigious for you, and we don't want 
            to talk to you. That said, if you really want to speak to someone, click 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.
